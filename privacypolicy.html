        <li>Continued use of the app after changes are published constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2.7 Payment & Subscription Terms</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mind Alchemy offers optional premium features and services through subscriptions or in-app purchases made via the Apple App Store. When you choose to upgrade, your selected payment method (such as your Apple ID or linked card) will be charged the price shown, along with any applicable taxes. By completing a subscription or purchase, you authorize Apple to securely process the payment on your behalf.</li>
    <li>By subscribing or making in-app purchases, you acknowledge that additional terms and conditions from the App Store may also apply, and you agree to review and accept them. Mind Alchemy is not responsible for any errors in payment processing handled by these external providers. We encourage you to review their policies thoughtfully before proceeding, as there are no refunds.</li>
    <li>Your subscription will continue uninterrupted and renew automatically unless you cancel according to the terms of the App Store. Please note that some features and content may be available for free in limited form, allowing you to explore and experience the energy of the app before deciding to subscribe.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Automatic Renewal</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you enroll in a subscription, it will automatically renew under the same terms and billing cycle unless you cancel it prior to the renewal date. To avoid unwanted charges, you must cancel your subscription before your current subscription period or renewal period ends, based on the policies of the App Store. Deleting the app or your account does not cancel an active subscription — cancellations must be made directly through the App Store.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payment Methods and Security</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You may pay for your order using the payment options offered by the App Store, including credit card, debit card, Apple Pay, or other supported methods. Mind Alchemy does not have access to or store any of your payment information. All transactions are securely processed by the App Store.</li>
    <li>The terms and conditions related to payment options offered by the App Store and Apple Pay are available at: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applicable Taxes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All listed prices are final but may vary from time to time based on offers, discounts, or applicable taxes. Before completing your purchase, you will be notified of any applicable taxes based on your location. Taxes will be clearly displayed during the checkout process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Price Changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mind Alchemy reserves the right to adjust subscription prices or cancel services at any time. If the subscription price changes, you will be notified by the App Store prior to your next billing cycle, and your continued use constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree to the new price, you may cancel your subscription before the renewal. If you cancel and later choose to re-subscribe, the price available at that time will apply.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>We appreciate your conscious participation and are honored to be a companion on your journey of transformation.</em></p>

    <p><em>Thank you for using Mind Alchemy. May it support your journey inward and upward.</em></p>
